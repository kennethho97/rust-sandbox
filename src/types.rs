/*Primitive Types--
Integers: u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128 
(number of bits they take in memeory)

Floats:f32, f64

Boolean (bool)

Characters (char)

Tuples

Arrays (Fixed length, Vectors are "growable" arrays)

Rust is a statically typed language, it must know the types of all variables at
compile time. However, the compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based
on the value and how we use it.
